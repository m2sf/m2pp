Modula-2 Preprocessor

M2PP is a simple preprocessor for the Modula-2 language.

It generates Modula-2 source files from generic Modula-2 source file templates. Its primary purpose is to provide a means to write and maintain dialect independent code that is portable across different Modula-2 dialects. However, it can also be used for generic programming where the Modula-2 dialect or compiler does not support generics.
