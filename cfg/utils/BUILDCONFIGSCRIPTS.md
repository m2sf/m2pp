### Build Configuration Scripts ###

This directory contains the build configuration scripts for different operating systems:

* `config.sh` for the bash shell used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems
* `config.bat` for the command interpreter on Windows, MS-DOS and OS/2
* `config.com` for the DCL command language on OpenVMS

A build configuration script for AmigaOS shall be added in the future.
